## Cats and Rats

This tutorial is intended as a small tutorial for the Greenfoot interface. It consists of a small simulation game that has the following actors:

0. The **rats** will try to eat every piece of **cheese**, but will flee if there are **cats** nearby
0. The **cats** will chase the **rats**
0. The **mousetraps** will immobilize **rats** that step on them
0. The **cheese** pieces just stand there until they are eaten
0. The **cone** blocks the way of the **cats** and **rats**
