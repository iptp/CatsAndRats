## Cats and Rats

This tutorial is intended to teach how to:

* Add Actors to the world
* Control the simulation
* Inspect an object's fields
* Call methods
* Make small changes to the source code
* Test those changes



The scenario consists of a cat-and-mouse simulation with four kinds of actors:

0. The **rats** will try to eat every piece of **cheese**, but will flee if there are **cats** nearby
0. The **cats** will chase the **rats**
0. The **mousetrap** will immobilize **rats** that step on them
0. The **cheese** just stands there until it's eaten
